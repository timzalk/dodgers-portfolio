## Selected Data-Oriented Projects
*This is a sample of three projects from my coursework in Syracuse University's MS Applied Data Science program. These three projects show a wide variety of skills and tools, from databases, to visualizations, to exploritory analysis and modeling. I am unable to share projects from current or recent employers due to confidentiality agreements. Most of my experience in predictive modeling has been done in a professional context*
