## Selected Data-Oriented Projects  

This is a sample of three projects from my coursework in Syracuse University's MS Applied Data Science program. These three projects show a wide variety of skills and tools, from databases, to visualizations, to exploritory analysis and modeling. I am unable to share projects from current or recent employers due to confidentiality agreements. Most of my experience in predictive modeling has been done in a professional context.


- college-scorecard
  - This report shows an analysis conducted using the US Government’s College Scorecard dataset, metrics and demographics used to evaluate and compare US colleges. The project attempted to predict a college attendee’s future income level based on their school.
- crime-in-la-viz
  - Visualiztions of various crime metrics in LA. Python and R were used to create the visuals, with aditional editing of exported vector files done in Adobe Illustrator.
